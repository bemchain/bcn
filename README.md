Company vision and commitment
BEM foundation's greatest asset is its investors and its experts in Blockchain and 
Network Marketing.
The identity people involved with BEM foundation projects will remain hidden 
as privacy and ownerships are secured through Blockchain.
BEM foundation will raise funds needed for projects through initial offerings (i.e. 
ICOs), and each major project will have its own dedicated token.
BEM foundation's vision is to ever expand entrepreneurial projects with 
assistance and usage of Blockchain and Network Marketing, so the investor 
would have peace of mind and the ability to participate at any time or place.
BEM foundation after the successful introduction of BEMT Token1
aims to 
reach the following goals in 2022:
 Creating a Decentralized Exchange
 Introducing a dedicated wallet
 Creating a dedicated Blockchain and upgrading BEMT token to BEM coin

BEMEX (BEM Exchange)
BEMEX is one of BEM foundation ICO projects. The name of BEMEX is 
derived from letter “B” of BEM foundation and the word “exchange” together
(formerly called Bexchange).
At the starting point BEMEX will be a centralized exchange system but in future 
if the tech is mature enough it is possible to migrate to decentralized or hybrid 
models.
BEMEX will have an inclusive model toward all coins and tokens, so all the 
cryptocurrencies which are verified through reference analytic websites or are 
tradable on other top cryptocurrency exchanges would all be available to trade on 
BEMEX.
In order to initiate BEMEX, BEM foundation will raise money by offering BCN 
token. There are overall 500 Million BCN tokens which will be released and sold 
in bemchain.io exponential monetization project.
BEMEX will in addition to trade platforms support, also have monetization plan 
which commission will be paid for referring new user and their transaction. The 
multilayer monetization plan will most likely have tremendous effect gaining new 
user and turnover.

Bemchain
The Bemchain.io project is responsible for ICO and selling BCN token to finance 
the BEMEX. BCN token will be sold with network marketing plans and 
interesting perk and features are assigned for bemchain.io users (for more 
information with bemchain.io website).
Use case promotion and increasing financial turnover for BEMT token is one of 
bemchain.io main goals. Participation in bemchain.io projects and buying BCN 
token is only possible with BEMT token.
During active days of BEMEX project and till finishing the sale of BCN and 
releasing the token to the market, BCN token will be more and more known to 
the public. Right after the release of BCN token, BEM foundation next project 
will be initiate and the funding will only be possible with BCN token.
BCN tokens in individual wallets are frozen and these token will be release 
gradually for the holders, so there will be no sell pressure on the token. Also new 
individual who want to invest in BEM foundation will have to buy BCN to invest 
in foundation’s new tokens, so the demand for BCN token will remain high as it 
earn value with commission fees it gets through trades.

BCN Token
BCN is of the BEM foundation's tokens which aims to raise fund for BEM 
Exchange with ICO. BCN is a utility token that will be used in BEMEX project. 
The money raised with sale of BCN tokens will be used to build a decentralized 
exchange on BEM blockchain. BCN tokens will be used on BEMEX to discount 
and some other services related to the exchange (e.g. transaction fee, etc)
BCN token will be released and distributed based on BEMChain smart contract.

ICO method
BCN token ICO will be take place by using the BEM Chain smart contract. To 
buy BCN tokens investors should visit bemchain.io website and follow the steps 
explained in the ICO page.
It only possible to buy BCN token with BEMT token. Investors will for each 1 
BEMT token get 10 unit of BCN tokens. BCN tokens are first shown in 
individual user account and then can be deposited from their account to personal 
wallet.
Minimum amount of investment in BCN is 2000 units which equal to paying 200 
BEMT tokens. It is possible buy more BCN in multiples of 2000 (e.g. 2000, 4000, 
6000, etc.). And maximum amount of purchase is 500/000 units for each user.

BCN token freeze and unlock time
BCN token, after deposition from user account to personal wallet will be frozen 
for 2 years. The 2 years is the maximum amount of freeze time for tokens; If BCN 
Page 12 www.bemchain.io
tokens are sold out earlier than said 2 years, the unlock time will be shortened the 
same amount.
Example: if all BCN tokens are sold out in 18 months, the freeze time will be 
reduced to the same duration and each individuals token will be frozen only for 
18 month in their wallet after their purchase and deposition to their wallets.
But if it takes longer than 2 year to sell all the BCN tokens, the unlock procedure 
will be done in that exact 2 years period and not more, and each individual tokens 
will be unlocked 2 years after their purchase and deposition to their wallets.
Each individual can visit his/her own virtual work office in BEM Chain system 
and from the BCN token section can view and withdraw the tokens. After clicking 
on withdraw option the mining command will be send to BEM Chain smart 
contract and the token will be deposited to your wallet. The unlock time of token 
will be initiated right after this deposition of BCN into your wallet. 

Token Burning
Right after the final unlocking and initiation of the BCN usage in BEM chain and 
BEMEX, there will be monthly token burn for BCN, equal to one percent of 
project's net profit. This will be done to prompt the price increase of BCN.
The specifics of token burning my vary due to the long time that unlocking of all 
BCN would take, so BEM foundation may take the best strategy for the future of 
BCN token

BCN token use cases
The three major use cases of BCN token will be usage in bemchain.io project and
as exchange token in BEMEX website.

BCN in BEMEX
After the launch of BEM Exchange, the BCN token will be used as main 
exchange coin on BEMEX, so if individuals have BCN token on the wallet 
connected to the exchange, the commission fee for transfer will be reduced. And 
also the commission and transaction cost is reduced if BCN is one end of the 
currency pair.
In the referral program, for inviting new users to the exchange, multilayer 
commission will be paid with BCN token.
It is possible that Liquidity, Staking and similar features will be added to BEMEX, 
and all these related projects will use BCN token.
